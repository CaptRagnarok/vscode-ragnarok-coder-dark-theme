### VERSION

0.75.0

# DESCRIPTION

A yellow/blue theme optimized for HTML / CSS / JS. Developed for my personal use, but if people like it, I might continue working on it. Also may continue development for other languages upon request.

## KNOWN ISSUES

Upon developing, I couldn't find a way to address how to highlight HTML tags properly.
VS Code seems to have added a built in, native support which highlights the opening and closing tags on its own, but I haven't been able to find the settings or code pieces that would allow me to address the color of that highlight so it stayed orange/brown, the default. Will implement a fix once I find it.

### FEEDBACK WELCOME!

If anyone would like to give feedback, or an idea how to make the theme better, please do!
